## outstanding issues:


1. publish into designated textarea on HTML, currently publishes into p tag underneath;

2. validation on third prompt for number of password characters need debugging: converting the entry to number to validate it and fail to convert back to string to store the password

3. fixed: various scenario of answer to prompts require more debugging

4. consider to populate the letterUC array on a fly?

5. consider define array properties through prototype rather via first character hardcoded

6. consider better ways of validating prompts, especially functions chicken(), rabits() and birds()

7. consider re-writing for better logic, expecially looping through array's index

8. finally: update readme file and comment on working file

9. attach code to the html button

10. fault invalid alert message appears on "no yes" scenario
